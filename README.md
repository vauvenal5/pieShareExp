pieShare
========

PieShare is intended to become THE open source private cloud tool. Our goal is not only to create a program that easily allows accessing your data over the cloud and sharing it with other users but also to keep your data really private.

In easy words pieShare is a tool like google drive, dropbox, etc. However your data stays at home and is not on some trustfull server(?... with backups on the NSA servers ;)) in the internet.

Contribute
----------

At this time pieShare is running as a bachalor project at the Technical Univeristy of Vienna. Therefore it is not possible to contribute for the time being. When pieShare enters the next phase of development we are happy to welcome new contributers. :)

Project Management Cycle
------------------------

The complete project management is realised over github. Our development cycles are represented through Milstones which contain the task which will be finished and bugs which will be fixed. Further [Huboard](http://huboard.com/vauvenal5/pieShare/board) is used for a simplier overview of the pending tasks.

Every task or bug issue runs through the following development steps:
* Ready - Task has been defined and is ready for development. / Bug entry has been accepted as bug and will be fixed.
* Working - Issue has been assigned for development. Every issue stays in the working catagory until not only developed but also covered by unit or integration tests.
* Ready - Issue has been developed and tested and is waiting for verification by one or more other developers.
* Closed - After verification the developer verifing closes the issue with a short comment.
